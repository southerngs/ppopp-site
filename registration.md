### Registration Details

Conference registration includes admission to the conference, digital
conference proceedings, banquet and excursion, breakfast, coffee breaks, and
lunches. 

During registration process you can also purchase 
1 or 2 days of workshop/tutorial passes, as well as extra social event tickets.
Workshop/tutorial only registrations are also available on the main registration page.
Authors can purchase up to two additional pages beyond the standard 12-page paper length.

Students attending U.S. universities are also eligible to apply for [PPoPP's NSF funded
student travel grant](../travel-grant), and all students who are authors of a paper are eligible to apply
for a [SIGPLAN travel grant](http://pac.sigplan.org/).  Note that funds received from travel grants cannot
be used to pay conference registration fees as the student fees are already discounted.

### Registration Site
