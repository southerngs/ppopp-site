## <a name="paolo"></a>Computing in a Persistent (Memory) World



### *Paolo Faraboschi, HP Labs*

### Monday, February 9th (8:50am-10:00am)

**Abstract:** By end of the decade we expect over 30 billion intelligent devices
connected to the internet, resulting in unprecedented amounts of data. At the
same time, scaling of the memory technologies that are at the foundation of
computing today will significantly slow down. We will need transformational
changes to the way in which we collect, process, store, and analyze that data.
Not everyone realizes that these changes will revolutionize the way in which we
architect and program computing systems. This talk will discuss the technology
trends, the implications to software and programming, and what we are doing at
HP to address some of the challenges. Starting from the emerging non-volatile
devices, it will cover how they will enable flattening and re-architecting the
memory hierarchy. Then, it will dive into the implications to software,
discussing how file systems, databases and explicit applications can take
advantage of large, flat and persistent memory spaces.

Paolo Faraboschi is an HP Fellow at HP Labs. His interests are at
the intersection of system architecture and software. He is currently working
on TheMachine project, researching how we can build better systems around
non-volatile memory. In the last five years, he worked on low-energy servers
and HP project Moonshot. From 2004 to 2009, at HPL in Barcelona, he led a
research activity on scalable system-level simulation and modeling. From 1995
to 2003, at HPL Cambridge, he was the principal architect of the Lx/ST200
family of VLIW cores, widely used in video SoCs and HP’s printers. Paolo is an
IEEE Fellow and an active member of the computer architecture community: guest
co-editor of IEEE Micro TopPicks 2012, Program co-Chair for HiPEAC10 (2010),
MICRO41 (2008) and MICRO34 (2001). He holds 25 patents and co-authored the book
“Embedded Computing: a VLIW approach to architecture, compiler end tools”.
Before joining HP in 1994, he received a Ph.D. in EECS from the University of
Genoa, Italy.

## <a name="wecker">LIQUi|>: Simulation and Compilation of Quantum Algorithms

### *Dave Wecker, Architect, Microsoft Research*

### Wednesday, February 11th (8:15am-9:25am)

**Abstract:** Languages, compilers, and computer-aided design tools will be
essential for scalable quantum computing, which promises an exponential leap in
our ability to execute complex tasks. LIQUi|> is a modular software
architecture designed to simulate and control quantum hardware. It enables easy
programming, compilation, and simulation of quantum algorithms and circuits,
and is independent of a specific quantum architecture. This talk will focus on
simulation of quantum algorithms in Quantum Chemistry and Materials as well as
Factoring, Quantum Error Correction and compilation for hardware
implementations ([http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4467](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4467)).

Dave came to Microsoft in 1995 and helped create the “Blender”
(digital video post-production facility). He designed and worked on a Broadband
MSN offering when he became architect for the Handheld PC v1 & v2 as well as
AutoPC v1 and Pocket PC v1. He moved to Intelligent Interface Technology and
resurrected SHRDLU for Natural Language research as well as building a state of
the art Neural Network based Speech Recognition system. For the Mobile Devices
Division he implemented secure DRM on e-books and Pocket PCs. He created and
was director of ePeriodicals before taking on the role of Architect for
Emerging Technologies. This lead to starting the Machine Learning Incubation
Team and then architect for Parallel Computing Technology Strategy working on
Big Data and now Quantum Computing. He has over 20 patents for Microsoft and 9
Ship-It awards. He started coding professionally in 1973, worked in the AI labs
at CMU while obtaining a BSEE and MSIA and was at DEC for 13 years (ask him
about DIDDLY sometime ;).
