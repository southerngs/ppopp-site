The Association for Computing Machinery does not issue formal invitation
letters for Visas to attend ACM sponsored conferences. We can however issue a
visa support letter. For Visa support letters, please send all requests to the
Office of SIG Services at supportletters@acm.org with the following information:

1.  Your name as it appears on your passport
2.  Current postal mailing address
3.  The name of the conference you wish to attend
4.  Your Registration Confirmation Number
5.  If you have any papers accepted for the conference, please provide the title and indicate whether you are the ‘sole author’ or a ‘co-author’

Please note visa support letters are issued via email by PDF and the original is mailed to your current postal address.
