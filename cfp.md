**PPoPP 2015 - Call for Papers**

PPoPP is the forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel
programming, including foundational and theoretical aspects,
techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and
practical experiences. In the context of the symposium, "parallel
programming" encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems
(multicore, multithreaded, heterogeneous, clustered systems,
distributed systems, grids, clouds, and large scale machines). Given
the rise of parallel architectures into the consumer market (desktops,
laptops, and mobile devices), PPoPP is particularly interested in work
that addresses new parallel workloads, techniques, and tools that
attempt to improve the productivity of parallel programming, and work
towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures. Specific
topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

+ Parallel programming theory and models
+ Formal analysis and verification
+ Parallel programming languages
+ Compilers and runtime systems for parallel and heterogeneous systems
+ Task-parallel libraries
+ Parallel application frameworks
+ Software productivity for parallel programming
+ Middleware for parallel systems
+ Performance analysis, debugging and optimization
+ Development, analysis, or management tools
+ Parallel algorithms
+ Parallel applications
+ Concurrent data structures
+ Synchronization and concurrency control
+ Software engineering for parallel programs
+ Fault tolerance for parallel systems
+ Software for heterogeneous architectures
+ Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems
+ Parallelism in non-scientific workloads: web servers, search, analytics, cloud computing

Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel
programming, and should contain enough background materials to make
them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community.

Papers describing experiences should indicate how they illustrate
general principles; papers about parallel programming foundations
should indicate how they relate to practice. Poster submissions should
meet similar criteria for originality and relevance, but may present
emerging ideas or results that are not yet sufficiently developed for
a full paper.

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference web
site. Abstracts must include contact information, the full list of
authors and their affiliations, and a description (100-400 words) of
the anticipated content of the paper. Full paper submissions must be
in PDF formatted for US lettersize paper. They must not exceed 10
pages (all inclusive) in standard ACM two-column conference format
(preprint mode, with page number). Templates for ACM format are
available for Microsoft Word, and LaTeX at
[http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm](http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm)  (use the 9 pt
template). Over-length submissions will not be accepted. Submissions
will be judged on correctness, relevance, originality, significance,
and clarity.

Paper submission is double-blind to reduce reviewer bias against or
for authors or institutions. Thus, the submissions cannot include
author names, institutions or hints based on references to prior
work. If authors are extending their own work, they need to reference
and discuss the past work in third person, as if they were extending
someone else's research. We realize that for some papers it will still
reveal authorship, but as long as an effort was made to follow these
guidelines, the submission will not be penalized. Authors must
identify any conflicts-of-interest with PC members and external review
committee members, as defined here:
[http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm](http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm) (ACM SIGPLAN policy).
Please see the [following FAQ](../files/dbr-faq.html) for more details about the double-blind
review process.

Poster submissions must conform to the same format restrictions, but
may not exceed 2 pages in length. Paper submissions that are not
accepted for regular presentations will automatically be considered
for posters; authors who do not want their paper considered for the
poster session should indicate this in their abstract
submission. Two-page summaries of posters will be included in the
conference proceedings.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may
be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The
official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings
are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over,
the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

PPoPP 2015 will be co-located with HPCA 2015 and CGO 2015 in the San
Francisco Bay Area.  Authors should carefully consider the difference 
in focus of the conferences when deciding where to submit a paper.

**Artifact Evaluation Process**

<img style="float: left" hspace="5" src="../images/Ae-stamp-ppopp2015.png">

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to formally submit their supporting
materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. The Artifact Evaluation process
is new this year and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how
the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This submission is
voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.
Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will
receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional
information is available on the [PPoPP AEC web page](http://ctuning.org/cm/wiki/index.php?title=Reproducibility:AE:PPoPP2015).

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make these materials publicly
available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source
materials” in the ACM Digital Library.
