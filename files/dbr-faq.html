    <h2>General</h2>
    <p><a name="g1"><b>Q</b>: <i>Why are you using double-blind
          reviewing?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: Our goal is to give each a reviewer an unbiased "first
      look" at each paper. Studies have shown that a reviewer's attitude
      toward a submission may be affected, even unconsciously, by the
      identity of the author. We want reviewers to be able to approach
      each submission without such involuntary reactions as "Barnaby; he
      writes a good paper" or "Who are these people? I have never heard
      of them." For this reason, we ask that authors to omit their names
      from their submissions, and that they avoid revealing their
      identity through citation. Note that many systems and security
      conferences use double-blind reviewing and have done so for years
      (e.g., SIGCOMM, OSDI, IEEE Security and Privacy, SIGMOD). PLDI, 
      POPL, and PPoPP have done it for several years now. </p>
    <p>A key principle to keep in mind is that we intend this process to
      be cooperative, not adversarial. If a reviewer does discover an
      author's identity though a subtle clue or oversight the author
      will not be penalized.</p>
    <p><a name="g2"><b>Q</b>: <i>Do you really think blinding actually
          works? I suspect reviewers can often guess who the authors are
          anyway.</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: Authorship can be guessed correctly sometimes, but
      imperfect blinding is better than no blinding at all, we believe.<br>
    </p>
    <p><a name="g3"><b>Q</b>: <i>Couldn't blind submission create an
          injustice where a paper is inappropriately rejected based upon
          supposedly-prior work which was actually by the same authors
          and not previously published?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: I have heard of this happening, and this is indeed a
      serious issue. In the approach we are taking for PPoPP'15, author
      names are revealed to reviewers after they have submitted their
      review. Therefore, reviewers can correct their review if they
      indeed have penalized the authors inappropriately. Unblinding
      prior to the PC meeting also avoids abuses in which committee
      members end up advancing the cause of a paper with which they have
      a conflict.
    </p>
    <h2>For authors</h2>
    <p><a name="a1"><b>Q</b>: <i>What exactly do I have to do to
          anonymize my paper?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity
      undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for our reviewers to
      evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. The
      specific guidelines stated in the call for papers are simple: omit
      authors' names from your title page (or list them as "omitted for
      submission"), and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the
      third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have
      worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying "We extend
      our earlier work on statically typed toads (Smith 2004)," you
      might say "We extend Smith's (2004) earlier work on statically
      typed toads." Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements
      that would give away your identity. </p>
    <p><a name="a2"><b>Q</b>: <i>I would like to provide supplementary
          material for consideration, e.g., the code of my
          implementation or proofs of theorems. How do I do this?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>:You may submit non-anonymized supplementary material by 
      emailing it (or links to it) to the program chair at any time
      after you have submitted your abstract to the submission system
      but before the final deadline for full paper submissions. This
      supplementary material need <b>not</b> be anonymized; it will
      only be revealed to reviewers after they have submitted their
      review of your paper and learned your identity. Reviewers are
      under no obligation to look at this material. The submission
      itself is the object of review and so it should strive to convince
      the reader of at least the plausibility of reported results;
      supplemental material only serves to confirm, in more detail, the
      idea argued in the paper. Of course, reviewers are free to change
      their review upon viewing supplemental material (or for any other
      reason). For those authors who wish to supplement, we encourage
      them to mention the supplement in the body of the paper. E.g.,
      "The proof of Lemma 1 is included in the non-anonymous
      supplemental material submitted with this paper."
    </p>
    <p><a name="a3"><b>Q</b>: <i>Is there a way for me to submit
          anonymous supplemental material which could be considered by a
          reviewer before she submits her review (rather than
          potentially non-anonymous material that can only be viewed
          afterward) ?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: You may submit modestly-sized anonymized supplementary 
      material (a few MB at most as a single file or zip archive) by emailing 
      it to the program chair at any time after you have submitted your abstract 
      to the submission system but before the final deadline for full paper 
      submissions. The program chair will make the material available to 
      the reviewers along with the paper at the time of review assignment,
      but the reviewers are under no obligation to look at the material.<br>
      There is no official channel for submitting large amounts of anonymized 
      supplementary material (eg the code for your entire system). 
      That said, there is nothing stopping an author from releasing a
      TR, code, etc. via an anonymous hosting service, and including a
      URL to that material in the paper. We point out this option not to
      encourage authors to exercise it, but to make them aware it
      exists, since we know of others who have used it. We emphasize
      that authors should strive to make their paper as convincing as
      possible on its own, in case reviewers choose not to access
      supplemental material.
    </p>
    <p><a name="a4"><b>Q</b>: <i>I am building on my own past work on
          the WizWoz system. Do I need to rename this system in my paper
          for purposes of anonymity, so as to remove the implied
          connection between my authorship of past work on this system
          and my present submission?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: No. The relationship between systems and authors
      changes over time, so there will be at least some doubt about
      authorship. Increasing this doubt by changing the system name
      would help with anonymity, but it would compromise the research
      process. In particular, changing the name requires explaining a
      lot about the system again because you can't just refer to the
      existing papers, which use the proper name. Not citing these
      papers runs the risk of the reviewers who know about the existing
      system thinking you are replicating earlier work. It is also
      confusing for the reviewers to read about the paper under Name X
      and then have the name be changed to Name Y. Will all the
      reviewers go and re-read the final version with the correct name?
      If not, they have the wrong name in their heads, which could be
      harmful in the long run.
    </p>
    <p><a name="a5"><b>Q</b>: <i>I am submitting a paper that extends
          my own work that previously appeared at a workshop. Should I
          anonymize any reference to that prior work?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: No. But we recommend you do not use the same title for
      your PPoPP submission, so that it is clearly distinguished from the
      prior paper. In general there is rarely a good reason to anonymize
      a citation. One possibility is for work that is tightly related to
      the present submission and is also under review. But such works
      may often be non-anonymous. When in doubt, contact the PC Chair.
    </p>
    <p><a name="a6"><b>Q</b>: <i>Am I allowed to post my (non-blinded)
          paper on my web page? Can I advertise the unblinded version of
          my paper on mailing lists or send it to colleagues? May I give
          a talk about my work while it is under review?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: As far as the authors' publicity actions are concerned,
      a paper under double-blind review is largely the same as a paper
      under regular (single-blind) review. Double-blind reviewing should
      not hinder the usual communication of results. </p>
    <p>That said, we do ask that you not attempt to deliberately subvert
      the double-blind reviewing process by announcing the names of the
      authors of your paper to the potential reviewers of your paper. It
      is difficult to define exactly what counts as "subversion" here,
      but some blatant examples include: sending individual e-mail to
      members of the PC or ERC about your work (unless they are
      conflicted out anyway), or posting mail to a major mailing list
      (e.g. TYPES) announcing your paper. On the other hand, it is
      perfectly fine, for example, to visit other institutions and give
      talks about your work, to present your submitted work during job
      interviews, to present your work at professional meetings (e.g.
      Dagstuhl), or to post your work on your web page. PC/ERC members
      will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper
      unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your
      authorship information to them. If you're not sure about what
      constitutes "going out of your way", please consult directly with
      the Program Chair.
    </p>
    <p><a name="a7"><b>Q</b>: <i>Will the fact that PPoPP is
          double-blind have an impact on handling conflicts-of interest?
        </i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: Using DBR does not change the principle that reviewers
      should not review papers with which they have a conflict of
      interest, even if they do not immediately know who the authors
      are. Quoting (with slight alteration) from the <a
        href="http://www.sigplan.org/review_policies.htm">ACM SIGPLAN
        review policies document</a>:
    </p>
    <blockquote> A conflict of interest is defined as a situation in
      which the reviewer can be viewed as being able to benefit
      personally in the process of reviewing a paper. For example, if a
      reviewer is considering a paper written by a member of his own
      group, a current student, his advisor, or a group that he is seen
      as being in close competition with, then the outcome of the review
      process can have direct benefit to the reviewer's own status. If a
      conflict of interest exists, the potential reviewer should decline
      to review the paper.</blockquote>
    <p></p>
    <h2>For reviewers</h2>
    <p><a name="r1"><b>Q</b>: <i>What should I do if I if I learn the
          authors' identity? What should I do if a prospective PPoPP
          author contacts me and asks to visit my institution?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: If at any point you feel that the authors' actions are
      largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their
      identity, you should contact the Program Chair. Otherwise you
      should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from regular
      blind reviewing. In particular, you should refrain from seeking
      out information on the authors' identity, but if you discover it
      accidentally this will not automatically disqualify you as a
      reviewer. Use your best judgment.
    </p>
    <p><a name="r2"><b>Q</b>: <i>The authors have provided a URL to
          supplemental material. I would like to see the material but I
          worry they will snoop my IP address and learn my identity.
          What should I do?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: Contact the Program Chair, who will download the
      material on your behalf and make it available to you.
    </p>
    <p><a name="r3"><b>Q</b>: <i>If I am assigned a paper for which I
          feel I am not an expert, how do I seek an outside review?</i></a>
    </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: PC and ERC members should do their own reviews, not
      delegate them to someone else. If doing so is problematic for some
      papers, e.g., you don't feel completely qualified, then consider
      the
      following options. First, submit a review for your paper that is
      as
      careful as possible, outlining areas where you think your
      knowledge is
      lacking. Assuming we have sufficient expert reviews, that could be
      the
      end of it: non-expert reviews are valuable too, since conference
      attendees are by-and-large not experts for any given paper.
      Second, the
      review form provides a mechanism for suggesting additional expert
      reviewers to the PC Chair, who may contact them if additional
      expertise
      is needed.&nbsp;Please do NOT contact outside reviewers yourself.
      As a last resort, if you feel like your review would be extremely
      uninformed and you'd rather not even submit a first cut, contact
      the PC Chair, and another reviewer will be assigned. </p>
    <p><a name="r4"><b>Q</b>: <i>How do we handle potential conflicts
          of interest since I cannot see the author names?</i></a> </p>
    <p><b>A</b>: The conference review system will ask that you identify
      conflicts of interest when you get an account on the submission
      system. Please see the <a href="#a7">related question applied to
        authors</a> to decide how to identify conflicts. Feel free to
      also identify additional authors whose papers you feel you could
      not review fairly for reasons other than those given (e.g., strong
      personal friendship).
