### Industry Sponsors

The conference program and associated events is an excellent opportunity
to connect with students, researchers and engineers from both academia
and industry. Participation from industry makes a tremendous difference,
through financial donations and through the involvement of technical and
non-technical representatives in the conference's activities. We invite
all companies involved in parallel computing to engage with the
community. Company donations may be targeted at a specific purpose, such
as subsidizing student attendance, the participation of minorities, etc.
We will be happy to talk about ways to increase the visibility of our
sponsors at the conference.
